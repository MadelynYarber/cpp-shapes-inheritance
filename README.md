# Shapes Inheritance System
A console-based C++ application that uses inheritance and polymorphism to model geometric shapes. Built using a base abstract `Shape` class and derived classes: `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle`.

---

## Features

- Abstract base class (`Shape`) with pure virtual functions
- Derived classes override area and perimeter logic
- Menu-driven program to create and store shapes
- Runtime polymorphism with dynamic arrays of `Shape*`
- User-friendly console interaction

---

## Built With

- **C++**
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Abstract base class with virtual methods
- Manual memory management

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Polymorphic behavior with pointers to base class
- Overriding virtual methods in derived classes
- Dynamic array resizing and object storage
- Object-oriented structure and reuse
